FOREWORD: We all get stuck which is why write-ups exist however, I would suggest you try your best to come up with the correct answer before seeking the answer. Most problems are meant to be solved but a process must be followed which is why I explain the various steps/commands used in order to arrive at a solution. The answers are blurred and should be used more as a verification. Do your best ! Enjoy the process !
